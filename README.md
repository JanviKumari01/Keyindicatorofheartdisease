# Keyindicatorofheartdisease
#Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset related to heart disease and building predictive models to classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease based on various factors.
The script is written in Python and uses several libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

#Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn (imblearn)
plotly

#Models

The script includes the following models for classification:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
You can modify the script to use different models or adjust hyperparameters to improve performance.

#Results
The results of the model evaluation, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, will be displayed in the console. Additionally, confusion matrices and ROC curves are saved as image files in the project directory
